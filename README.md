# PyGraphicsEngine
 A learning project made in order to learn the concepts behind 3D Graphics, Might build on from ground up a fully fledge Graphic Game Engine once enough is understood

# Development Cycle: Testing and Learning
 Currently, at Testing and Learning stage, where I'd make spontanous changes within as to how this Engine functions.

# GOALS:
 1. Organized, Clean and Easily Understood code, Bug free if possible (pull requests contribute)

 2. Optimized to be a Considerable option as a 3D Game Engine for small games.

 3. Make it recognize any type of object file. {obj}
 (Might get support for other 3D files in the future)

 4. Develope a Basic Physics Engine.

 5. Be Able to create your own scripts to assist the developing games.

 6. Create an Intuitive 3D Graphic Developement Environment.

 For the time Being that's all that comes to mind for the future
