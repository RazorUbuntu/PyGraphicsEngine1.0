# PyGraphicsEngine
 A learning project made in order to learn the concepts behind 3D Graphics, Might build on from ground up a fully fledge Graphic Game Engine once enough is understood

# Development Cycle: Stable Release v1.0
 This release is the bare minimum of a graphics engine, yet it is the foundation of the future releases.
 As for now, one can import a certain type of model and watch it spin around. change it's color uniformly and it's size on the screen.
 Clipping has yet to be implemented hence out of bound model sizes might crash the script. so use it with care.

# Features of v1.0:
 1. Organized, Clean and Easily Understood code, Bug free (pull requests contribute)

 2. Any Model of set format can be loaded into the engine. {obj}

 3. Choose a Uniform colour from a diverse selection of a 18! colors.

 4. Set a size of the model, if you do enough digging you can find even the way to offset the model.

 5. Set the speed of rotation and watch your model spin around.

 6. View it with a Wireframe or pure 3D object or 3D object with Wireframe

 For the time Being that's all that comes to mind for the future
