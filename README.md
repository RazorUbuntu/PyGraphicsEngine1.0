# PyGraphicsEngine
 A learning project made in order to learn the concepts behind 3D Graphics, Might build on from ground up a fully fledge Graphic Game Engine once enough is understood

# Development Cycle: Stable Release v1.0
 This release is the bare minimum of a graphics engine, yet it is the foundation of the future releases.
 As for now, one can import a certain type of model and watch it spin around. change it's color uniformly and it's size on the screen.
 Clipping has yet to be implemented hence out of bound model sizes might crash the script. so use it with care.

# GOALS:
 1. Organized, Clean and Easily Understood code, Bug free if possible (pull requests contribute)

 2. Optimized to be a Considerable option as a 3D Game Engine for small games.

 3. Make it recognize any type of object file. {obj}
 (Might get support for other 3D files in the future)

 4. Develope a Basic Physics Engine.

 5. Be Able to create your own scripts to assist the developing games.

 6. Create an Intuitive 3D Graphic Developement Environment.

 For the time Being that's all that comes to mind for the future
